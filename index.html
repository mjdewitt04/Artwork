    This piece is a video edit titled "Off Ya Feet Mixtape" and it was created using Adobe After Effects. The media in this includes a song and some video game clips. I synced the video clips to match the speed/tempo of the song, essentially creating a highlight tape. </p>

    This piece was a video edit of someone who was transferring from a junior college to a state school to play basketball. I used a song and video clips of her choosing to create a congratulatory video for her big achievement. </p>

    <img style="width: 70%; border-color: lightgreen;" src = "Portrait.jpg" border="10">
    <p style = "font-size: 36px; background-color: lightgreen;">This is one of the first attempts of mine using code to create art. I had to make a self portrait using Processing and I did that by using simple shape commands. After that I colored the shapes in to achieve something that resembles myself. </p>

    <p style = "font-size: 36px; background-color: darkgreen;color: white;">This piece was created in Processing and is used as a hair cutting simulator. I brought an image in and made the background white. I inserted an animation that paints white as you hover over the image and paints brown back in when you click. This makes it to where you can take hair away and paint it back in if you messed up. </p>

    <p style = "font-size: 36px; background-color: lightgreen;">This piece is titled 'Glitchigo' with its medium being Photoshop as well as Audacity.
